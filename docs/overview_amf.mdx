# What is AMF?

[AMF](https://github.com/aml-org/amf) (AML Modeling Framework) is an open-source library capable of parsing and validating  AML metadata documents.
AMF is written in Scala(JS) and can be executed in the JVM, Node.js or the browser.
AMF can be used as a standalone command-line tool or as a library in Scala, Java, web or node applications.

AMF source code is publicly available under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) in the [AMF Github repository](https://github.com/aml-org/amf).

Artifacts to use AMF can be obtained from:

-   [Maven](https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mulesoft/)
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amf-client-js)

AMF has a modular architecture for integrating plugins for other types of metadata beyond AML. An example of these plugins is the web-api module capable of parsing [RAML](https://raml.org/) and [OAS](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (formerly Swagger) API specification languages.
