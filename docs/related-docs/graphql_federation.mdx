## Summary
AMF supports APIs defined as GraphQL Subgraph APIs compliant with the [Apollo Federation v2 spec](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/b85e307f9c471864a799f1b05e28ce7c24bc05b7/docs/source/federation-spec.md)

:::info
The *Apollo Federation v2 spec* has been revised since the revision mentioned in the above link.

No explicit mentions on backwards compatibility between Apollo Federation v2 spec revisions are mentioned in the Apollo documentation.
_We assume Apollo Federation v2 spec revisions are backwards compatible_.
:::

To get started with Federation you should use the [GraphQLFederationConfiguration](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/amf-graphql/shared/src/main/scala/amf/graphqlfederation/client/scala/GraphQLFederationConfiguration.scala)

## AMF Federation Model
The AMF Federation model contains the required information to Federate both GraphQL and Rest APIs. In GraphQL this comes in the form of federating [Shapes](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#shape)
while in REST APIs federating [Operations](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#operation).

Below is a list of the relevant model parts. Please refer to the linked documentation for each case for more information.

#### [Key](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#key)
Contains the information from keys that identify federated Shapes or Operations
(`@key` directive in Apollo, read "Note on Apollo __FieldSet_ DSL")

#### [FederationMetadata](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#customdomainproperty)
Contains different kinds of metadata from a federated Shape or Operation. Each of this has it own federation metadata,
[ShapeFederationMetadata](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#shapefederationmetadata) and
[OperationFederationMetadata](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#operationfederationmetadata) respectively.

#### Some properties:
* http://a.ml/vocabularies/federation#isStub: Indicates if an element is a stub from an external component from another component of the federated graph
* http://a.ml/vocabularies/federation#requires: External properties (by path) required to retrieve data from this property during federation
(`@requires` directive in Apollo, read "Note on Apollo __FieldSet_ DSL")
* http://a.ml/vocabularies/federation#provides: External properties (by path) that can be provided by this graph during federation
(`@provides` directive in Apollo, read "Note on Apollo __FieldSet_ DSL")

#### Note on Apollo __FieldSet_ DSL
Apollo allows to use the [Value](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#Value) GraphQL construct to reference fields that
make up a key. This construct is a tree. In AMF such construct is flattened and represented as a sequence of
[PropertyShapePath](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#propertyshapepath) where
each PropertyShapePath represents the traversal from the root of the tree to each of the leaf nodes.


## Parsing support

AMF supports parsing APIs defined as GraphQL Subgraphs compliant with the [Apollo Federation v2 spec](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/b85e307f9c471864a799f1b05e28ce7c24bc05b7/docs/source/federation-spec.md).
Federation directives are supported out of the box __without having to declare them nor import them with the `@link` directive__.

Federation directives are parsed differently from other directives. Non-federation directive applications will be parsed as [DomainExtensions](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#domainextension)
and their corresponding declaration as [CustomDomainProperty](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/documentation/model.md#customdomainproperty). Federation directives are parsed instead as part of the __Federation model__.

### Supported directives
* `@external`
* `@requires`
* `@provides`
* `@key`
* `@shareable`
* `@inaccessible`
* `@override`

### Non parsed directives
These directives __do not require declaration__. Parsing these __will produce no effect on the output AMF model__.
* `@link`

### Not supported directives
These directives __require declaration__ despite being part of the [Apollo Federation v2 spec](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/b85e307f9c471864a799f1b05e28ce7c24bc05b7/docs/source/federation-spec.md).
Support for these will be added in subsequent AMF releases.

* `@tag`
* `@composeDirective`
* `@extends`: AMF supports the built in `extend` GraphQL keyword so it is not necessary to use this directive

## Transformation support
The [GraphQLFederationConfiguration](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/amf-graphql/shared/src/main/scala/amf/graphqlfederation/client/scala/GraphQLFederationConfiguration.scala)
provides the following transformation pipelines:
* __Editing__: transforms a parsed GraphQL Subgraph API into the AMF canonical model __with ID__ shortening
* __Cache__: transforms a parsed GraphQL Subgraph API into the AMF canonical model __without__ ID shortening
* __Introspection__: transforms a parsed GraphQL Subgraph API into the model obtained from performing introspection on a
running instance of such GraphQL Subgraph API. Follows the steps under the [`buildSubgraphSchema`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/b85e307f9c471864a799f1b05e28ce7c24bc05b7/docs/source/subgraphs.mdx#4-generate-the-subgraph-schema) function in Apollo

## Validation support
Federation introduces stricter validations then GraphQL. The [GraphQLFederationConfiguration](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/master/amf-graphql/shared/src/main/scala/amf/graphqlfederation/client/scala/GraphQLFederationConfiguration.scala)
is capable of validating such stricter constraints. Examples of these are:
* `@key` directive must point to existing properties
* Fields targeted by `@requires` should be annotated as `@external`
* Fields targeted by `@provides` should be annotated as `@external`
* Cannot declare types nor fields with reserved federation names like *_FieldSet*, *_Entity*, *_Service*, *_entities* and *_service*
