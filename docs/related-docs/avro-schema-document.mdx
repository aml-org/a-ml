# AVRO Schema Document Support

AMF supports parsing AVRO Schemas in two different ways:
- as standalone documents defined in plain JSON as `.json` or `.avsc` files
- inside a message payload in an AsyncAPI

AMF supports ONLY the [AVRO Schema 1.9.0 specification](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.9.0/spec.html#schemas).

## Where we support and DON'T support AVRO Schemas
We Support AVRO Schemas (inline or inside a `$ref`):
- as standalone documents defined in plain JSON as `.json` or `.avsc` files
  - we encourage users to use the `.avsc` file type to indicate that's an avro file
  - must use the specific `AvroConfiguration`
  - the avro specific document `AvroSchemaDocument` can only be parsed with the specific `AvroConfiguration`
- inside a message payload in an AsyncAPI
  - the key `schemaFormat` MUST be declared and specify it's an AVRO payload
  - **we only support avro schema version 1.9.0**

We don't support AVRO Schemas:
- inside components --> schemas in an AsyncAPI
  - because we can't determine if it's an AVRO Schema or any other schema

## Requirements
An AVRO Schema doesn't have a special key that indicates it's an AVRO Schema, nor it's version (like JSON Schema does with it's `$schema`).
Thus, a special `AMFConfiguration` has been created to handle AVRO Documents called `AvroConfiguration`.

On the other hand, Using AVRO Schemas inside AsyncAPIs requires no special configuration,
only that the `schemaFormat` points to the 1.9.0 version, with one of the following values:
- application/vnd.apache.avro;version=1.9.0
- application/vnd.apache.avro+json;version=1.9.0
- application/vnd.apache.avro+yaml;version=1.9.0

For more information on how to parse documents with AMF check the [parsing documentation](/docs/amf/using-amf/amf_parsing).


## AVRO Schema mappings to the AMF APIContract Model

An AVRO Schema may be a:
- Map
- Array
- Record (with fields, each one being any of the possible types)
- Enum
- Fixed Type
- Primitive Type ("null", "boolean", "int", "long", "float", "double", "bytes", "string")

We've parsed each AVRO Type to the following AMF Shape:
- Map --> NodeShape with `AdditionalProperties` field for the values shape
- Array --> ArrayShape with `Items` field for the items shape
- Record --> NodeShape with `Properties` with a PropertyShape that contains each field shape
- Enum --> ScalarShape with `Values` field for it's symbols
- Fixed Type --> ScalarShape with `Datatype` field for its type and `Size` for its size
- Primitive Type --> ScalarShape with `Datatype` field, or NilShape if its type 'null'

Given that in these mappings several AVRO Types correspond to a ScalarShape or a NodeShape, **we've added the `avro-schema` annotation** with an `avroType` that contains the avro type declared before parsing.
This way, we can know the exact type for rendering or other purposes, for example having a NodeShape and knowing if it's an avro record or a map (both are parsed as NodeShapes).

We've also added 3 AVRO-specific fields to the `AnyShape` Model via the `AvroFields` trait, adding the following fields:
- AvroNamespace
- Aliases
- Size



## AVRO Validation
We'll use the Apache official libraries for JVM and JS, in the version 1.11.3, due Java8 binary compatibility requirements.

### Constraints
The validation libraries differ in interfaces and implementations, and each has some constraints:

### JVM avro validation library
- validation per se is not supported, we try to parse an avro schema and throw parsing results if there are any
- this means it's difficult to have location of where the error is thrown, we may give an approximate location from our end post-validation
- when a validation is thrown, the rest of the file is not being searched for more validations
- this is particularly important in large avro schemas, where many errors can be found but only one is shown

### Both JVM & JS validation libraries
- `"default"` values are not being validated when the type is `bytes`, `map`, or `array`
- the validator treats as invalid an empty array as the default value for arrays (`"default": []`) even though the [Avro Schema Specification](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.12.0/specification) has some examples with it
- avro schemas of type union are not valid at the root level of the schema, but they are accepted as field types in a record or items in an array. For this reason, it is not possible to generate a `PayloadValidator` for an avro union shape.
- the avro libraries are very restrictives with the allowed characters in naming definition (names of records for example). They only allow letters, numbers and `_` chars. We are not modifying this behavior.
