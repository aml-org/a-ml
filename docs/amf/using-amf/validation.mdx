:::info
The legacy Custom Validation feature was removed in AMF 5.0.0. This feature was be replaced by
an external project called AMF Custom Validator. Check out the [project repository](https://github.com/aml-org/amf-custom-validator) for more information or read the
[Custom Validation](/docs/amf/using-amf/amf_custom_validation) section
:::

Validation is the process of checking that your model complies with the constraints you've defined for it.
If the model doesn't comply, you can determine where it's invalid and assess the severity.

After you've parsed and resolved the model, you can apply different AMF validations:
- **AMF API Contract Model validations**
  - These are programmatic constraints that are validated against the [API Contract Model](/docs/amf/using-amf/amf_model)
  - There are general validations, and validations specific to every API specification AMF supports
- **AML Validations**
  - Are generated in runtime from an AML Dialect

## Validation Examples
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeGetter from "/components/CodeGetter";

<Tabs
    groupId="languages"
    defaultValue="scala"
    values={[
        {label: 'Scala', value: 'scala'},
        {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
        {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'}
    ]}
>

<TabItem value="scala">
    <CodeGetter
        language='scala'
        example='ValidationTest.scala'
    />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">
    <CodeGetter
        language='java'
        example='ValidationTest.java'
    />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts">
    <CodeGetter
        language='ts'
        example='validation.spec.ts'
    />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


The final feature in the AMF repertoire is rendering, and you'll learn about it in the next section.
