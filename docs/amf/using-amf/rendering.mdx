Rendering is the process of exporting an AMF [API Contract Model](/docs/amf/using-amf/amf_model) to a specific format.
Any AMF model can be rendered as a standard JSON-LD or RDF graph. Additionally, in the case of the API Contract Model,
it can also be exported to RAML, OAS and AsyncAPI:

export const myStyle = {
    padding: "15px 5px",
};

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

![emission-graph](../../assets/images/amf/emision-graph.png)

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

Each rendering has limitations, as some elements may be unique to a specification and can't be represented in others.

AMF intends to support additional specifications as they become available.
