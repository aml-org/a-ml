title: Creating AMF model in memory
---
:::info
The functionality expressed in this documentation requires familiarity with the
[amf model](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md).
:::

AMF is most commonly used to parse an already existing API,
but it can also be used to create an API in a fluent and descriptive way.

Some use cases for creating a WebApi model in memory include:

- To edit an already parsed API with AMF
- When using AMF to power a visual API designer
- To create programmatic API tests


### Creating a WebApi with AMF programmatically
In the following code example we're going to create a generic 'Music Service API' with the following functionality:

- `/me` endpoint to retrieve user's profile
- `/me/playlists` endpoint to retrieve user's playlists
- `/albums` endpoint to retrieve a specific album or a list of albums by their IDs

As our focus is on building the API, all responses are going to be of type string, but you can further specify
requests and responses by defining a schema for an album, playlist or user.
