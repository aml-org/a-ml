:::info Technical Document

Within the Async specification it is possible to use RAML data types to define a payload, taking into account that the schema format is specified accordingly.
Both specifications have their own distinct referencing and modularization mechanisms, and it is not clear where to draw the line to determine where one specification stops, and the other one starts.
This document will describe how to use RAML types in Async when using AMF.


## Referencing external RAML content using `$ref`
In order to support referencing RAML content in external files, AMF allows the use of the `$ref` mechanism present in Async.
This enables referencing data type fragments, data types present in libraries, as well as any RAML content present in yaml or json files.

However, the usage of `$ref` in this scenario has some restrictions. Given that the payload content must comply with RAML,
**the `$ref` may only be used at the root of the payload definition as an exception to the RAML specification**.
Its target content must be valid structurally according to the relevant RAML specification:

export const myStyle = {
    padding: "15px 5px",
};

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="‘$ref’ at root of payload (Valid)"
schemaFormat: application/RAML+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
  $ref: “...” # must reference raml content
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="‘$ref’ nested within RAML content (Invalid)" {6}
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
 type: object
 properties:
   user:
     $ref: “...” # '$ref' is not valid in RAML
```

</div>
</div>
</div>


The following section shows all supported use cases when using this referencing mechanism, adding additional comments if necessary.



### Reference to data type fragments
The data type fragment must be self-contained, meaning it cannot depend on any definition made in the root API. The following example is **valid** for this use case.

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Async API"
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
 $ref: external-data-type.raml
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="RAML data type fragment (external-data-type.raml)"
#%RAML 1.0 DataType

type: object
properties:
  a: string | object
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

The following referenced data type is **invalid** as it is not self-contained, meaning the data type fragment depends on type definitions which will not be resolved in the root API.
Due to known limitations this API will not return any validations (error or warning), but the reference to the type `Other` inside the data type will not be made, leaving it unresolved.

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Async API"
components:
 schemas:
   Other: ...
channels:
 users/signup:
   subscribe:
     message:
       schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
       payload:
        $ref: external-data-type.raml
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="RAML data type fragment (external-data-type.raml)" {5}
#%RAML 1.0 DataType

type: object
properties:
 a: Other
```

</div>
</div>
</div>


Use of relative pointers to nested content within the data type fragment is not supported, like in the following **invalid** example:
```yaml {3}
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
 $ref: external-data-type.raml#/properties/a
```



### Reference to types in library fragments
For the case of libraries, type definitions can be referenced using the following fixed pointer: `{lib}#/types/{typeName}`.
When referencing types defined in a library, the included content will have context of other type definitions present in the original library.
This can be seen in the following **valid** example where the type User references another type present in the external library.

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Async API"
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
  $ref: ../external-library.raml#/types/User
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="RAML library fragment (external-library.raml)"
#%RAML 1.0 Library

types:
 User:
   type: Other | string

 Other:
   type: string
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

**The external library must be self-contained**, meaning it cannot depend on types defined in the root API.
In the following **invalid** example, the library depends on the definition of the type Other, which will not be resolved from the definitions present in the main API.

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Async API"
components:
 schemas:
   Other: ...
channels:
 users/signup:
   subscribe:
     message:
       schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
       payload:
        $ref: ../external-library.raml#/types/User
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="RAML library fragment (external-library.raml)" {5}
#%RAML 1.0 Library

types:
 User:
   type: Other | string
```

</div>
</div>
</div>



### Reference to external yaml/json files
When referencing external yaml or json files, the `$ref` inlines the content.
Relative json pointers can be used to reference content that is nested within the file, but taking into account the following limitation:

:::caution When referencing to external yaml/json files
the external file **must not** be a known RAML fragment or API specification.
:::

The following case is a **valid** reference making use of relative json pointers.

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Async API"
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
 $ref: external-yaml.yaml#/definitions/User
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Yaml file (external-yaml.yaml)"
definitions:
 User:
   type: string | object
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

As previously mentioned, when the target file is a known RAML fragment or API specification free use of relative json pointers is not supported.
The following example shows an **invalid** example when using relative json pointer to reference an external RAML specification:

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Async API"
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
 $ref: ../api.raml#/types/User
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="External RAML API (api.raml)" {1}
#%RAML 1.0
title: Instagram API

types:
 User:
   type: object
```

</div>
</div>
</div>



## Inlined RAML types
The simplest way to define a RAML type in Async is by defining your content inlined under the `payload` facet while using the appropriate schema format like so:
```yaml
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload: # The following is a RAML data type
 type: object
 properties:
   a: object | string
 additionalProperties: false
```
**All content within the payload will be considered strictly RAML**, except when using ‘$ref’ at the root of the payload (see the [previous section](#referencing-external-raml-content-using-ref) for more details).


### Isolated RAML context
When defining inlined types, its context is fully restricted from the content defined outside the payload facet.
This means that any reference to content defined in the `components` facet of the main Async API will not be resolved.

```yaml title="Referencing types defined in async API components (invalid)" {10}
components:
 schemas:
   User: ...
channels:
 users/signup:
   subscribe:
     message:
       schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
       payload:
         type: User #unresolved reference
```


### Limited RAML referencing mechanism
RAML has its own referencing mechanism to include content from external files using a reserved yaml tag `!include`.
**AMF will only support referencing external data type fragments using the `!include` tag.**
Furthermore, this will only work in Async APIs defined in yaml format, as json has no way of defining tags.

As this syntax is valid within a RAML context, including data types fragments can be made at the root of the payload content,
or nested within other inlined content:

<div className="container">
<div className='row'>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Using include at root of payload"
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload: !include external-data-type.raml
```

</div>
<div style={myStyle} className='col col--6'>

```yaml title="Using include within inlined content"
schemaFormat: application/raml+yaml;version=1.0
payload:
 type: object
 properties:
   id: string
   user: !include external-data-type.raml
```

</div>
</div>
</div>
