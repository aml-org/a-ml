To validate a model means checking if it complies with the constraints defined for it. In case it doesn't comply,
pinpoint where and how the model is invalid, and what severity this issue has.

Once the model has been parsed and resolved, AMF can apply two kinds of validations:
- **WebApi validations**
    - These are programmatic constraints that are validated against the WebApi model
    - There are general validations as well as others specific to every API Specification AMF supports
- **SHACL validations**
    - [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl) (Shapes Constraint Language) is a language designed to declare certain
    conditions that can be validated against [RDF graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) like the AMF Graph
    - Used mainly to validate AML Dialect Instances


The following figure explains the AMF Validation process:

## Validation Examples
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeGetter from "../../../components/CodeGetter";

<Tabs
    groupId="languages"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
        {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}
    ]}
>

<TabItem value="java">
    <CodeGetter
        language='java'
        codeUrl='examples/new-doc/src/test/java/ValidationTest.java'
    />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">
    <CodeGetter
        language='js'
        codeUrl='examples/new-doc/src/test/js/validation.test.js'
    />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


The final feature in the AMF repertoire is emission, and you'll learn about it in the next section.
