Resolution is the process of applying multiple transformations to the AMF Graph model. The complete resolution pipeline has the following steps:

![resolution pipeline](../../assets/images/amf/resolution-pipeline.png)

The most common use case of resolution is to flatten and simplify the model by:
- Resolving links and inheritances
- Applying traits and resourceTypes (in the case of RAML)
- Normalization of shapes and parameters

Another use case where resolution is of utmost importance is when making a conversion from one API specification to another.
For example, when converting a RAML API to OAS, multiple verifications and conversions are made in order to have a valid, OAS-compliant API.

## Pipelines
There are different types of pipelines that can be used in AMF, depending on the use case for which AMF is being used:
- **default**
    - keeps only the parsed graph model, deletes all information no longer relevant like `document.declares`
- **editing**
    - keeps all information in already parsed nodes, like the source and the declarations
    - for usages where someone is editing the API, like an interactive API designer that uses AMF in the background
- **compatibility**
    - MUST be used when converting an API to a different Spec
    - includes additional amf-specific information to aid in cross-specification conversion


## Examples
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeGetter from "../../../components/CodeGetter";

<Tabs
    groupId="languages"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
        {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}
    ]}
>

<TabItem value="java">
    <CodeGetter
        language='java'
        codeUrl='examples/new-doc/src/test/java/ResolutionTest.java'
    />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">
    <CodeGetter
        language='js'
        codeUrl='examples/new-doc/src/test/js/resolution.test.js'
    />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


In the next section you'll learn how validations can be applied to the resolved model to check its validity and report errors.
