title: Parsing with AMF
---

AMF is capable of parsing things like:

- AML dialects
- API specifications
  - RAML
  - OAS 2 & 3
  - AsyncAPI 2.0

In this section you'll learn how to parse each one of them, followed by practical examples.


## Parsing Basics
Let's cover what a parser does. Parsing is the process of analyzing text made of a sequence of tokens, and then building a data structure based on those tokens.

AMF uses [SYAML](https://github.com/aml-org/syaml) to read JSON or YAML files and generate [ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (abstract syntax tree)
from them, which is later used to generate a graph that represents the model. This can either be a WebApi model (represents an API, independent of its specification),
or an AML Document model (Dialect, Vocabulary or Dialect Instance).

The returned object obtained from parsing is always a [BaseUnit](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#baseunit). There are several Objects that are BaseUnits,
and depending on the file parsed, the actual object returned can be a [Fragment](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#fragment), a [Module](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#module),
a [Document](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#document) or many others, depending on the content in the source file.
For more in-depth model information check the [AMF Model](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md) resource.

The following figure shows the parsing process:

- SYAML is used to generate an AST from a YAML/JSON file.
- AMF uses this AST to generate a graph representation of the model, called BaseUnit.
    - This model is going to be used in the following stages of AMF.

## Parsing code examples
The paths given to the parser must have a specific structure:

Paths in Windows:

-   Absolute: `file:///C:/testing/api.raml`
-   Relative: `file:///api.raml`

Paths in Mac and Unix:

-   Absolute: `file:///Users/aml/testing/api.raml`
-   Relative: `file://api.raml`

Also, before parsing an AML dialect instance, the dialect must be registered using the `AMF.registerDialect()` function.
