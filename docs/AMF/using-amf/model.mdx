title: The AMF Model
---

The documentation available in this section is only a small fraction of what AMF can do.
For more in-depth information about the AMF model, you can refer to the [**AMF Model Documentation**](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md).

There you'll find how AMF represents the different concepts in different API specifications, as well as some abstract models like:

- [WebApi](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#webapi)
- [Document](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#document)
- [Shape](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#shape)
- [Dialect](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#dialect)

And that's all the information you need to start using AMF.
