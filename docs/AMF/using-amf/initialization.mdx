title: AMF initialization
---

As you've read in the [Code Setup](project_configuration.mdx#code-setup) of the previous section, the method `AMF.init()` initializes AMF and gets it ready to work.
In this section you'll learn how it does it, and what are the **different ways of initializing AMF**, depending on your use case.

In a nutshell, the initialization method registers the following plugins:
- WebApi
- Vocabularies
- AMFCustomValidation
- PayloadValidatorPlugin

Lastly, it initializes the core functionalities of amf by doing `amf.Core.init()`. You can easily see this when you inspect the `AMF.init()` method:

```scala title="AMF.scala"
def init(executionEnvironment: BaseExecutionEnvironment): ClientFuture[Unit] = {
    WebApi.register(executionEnvironment)
    Vocabularies.register()
    AMFCustomValidation.register()
    amf.Core.registerPlugin(PayloadValidatorPlugin)
    amf.Core.init(executionEnvironment)
}
```

Knowing this, you can cherry-pick the plugins you need and only use those.For example, let's say you only need to parse and resolve an OAS 3.0 specification.
For that you only need the WebApi plugin, so you can just do:

```java
WebApi.register();
Core.init().get();
```
That's exactly what we're doing in the [**parsing**](parsing.mdx) examples coming up next.
