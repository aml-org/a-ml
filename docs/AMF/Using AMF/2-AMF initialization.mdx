As you've read in the [Code Setup](amf_setup#code-setup) of the previous section, the method `AMF.init()` initializes AMF and gets it ready to work.
In this section you'll learn how the method works and what are the **different ways of initializing AMF** depending on your use case.

The initialization method registers the following plugins:
- WebApi
- Vocabularies
- AMFCustomValidation
- PayloadValidatorPlugin

The `AMF.init()` method initializes the core functions of AMF by running `amf.Core.init()`, as show in the following snippet:

```scala title="AMF.scala"
def init(executionEnvironment: BaseExecutionEnvironment): ClientFuture[Unit] = {
    WebApi.register(executionEnvironment)
    Vocabularies.register()
    AMFCustomValidation.register()
    amf.Core.registerPlugin(PayloadValidatorPlugin)
    amf.Core.init(executionEnvironment)
}
```

Knowing this, you can cherry-pick and use only the plugins you need. For example, if you wanted to parse and resolve the OAS 3.0 specification,
you would need only the WebApi plugin:

```java
WebApi.register();
Core.init().get();
```

For more information on parsing, see [**Parsing with AMF**](amf_parsing).
