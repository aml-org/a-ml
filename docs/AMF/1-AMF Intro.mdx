[AMF](https://github.com/aml-org/amf) (AML Modeling Framework) is an open-source library capable of parsing and validating  AML metadata documents.
AMF is fully written in Scala, and thanks to [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) it can be executed in the JVM, Node.js or the browser.
AMF can be used as a standalone command-line tool or as a library in Scala, Java, web or node applications.

AMF source code is publicly available under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) in the [AMF Github repository](https://github.com/aml-org/amf).

The modular design of AMF facilitates creating plugins capable of parsing other metadata syntaxes not defined by AML.
For example, the most used AMF module, the web-api module, is capable of parsing [RAML](https://raml.org/), [OAS](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (formerly Swagger) and [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi) API specification languages.
Furthermore, AMF can also validate APIs, and even emit them in different API languages.

## Vision
[AML](https://a.ml/aml-spec) allows users to formally describe different kinds of models, whether syntactic models (i.e. language/specification specific) or semantic models (i.e. domain/industry specific).
AMF can parse and generate descriptions of those models as sets of modular documents and store those connected descriptions into a single unified data graph.

## Goals
- Support for multiple formats with a unified programming interface and model
- Support for both syntactic and semantic model layers
- Support for validation at both syntactic and semantic model layers
- Produce formal specifications of any (specification) language
- Extensible, single syntactic model for multiple semantic models
- Ability to create consistent parsing behaviors across different syntactic models
- Support for bi-directional transformation and export
- Support for custom (parsing/resolution/generation) pipelines

## Native support

AMF natively supports the following formats:
- YAML
- JSON

the following semantic models:
- WebApi (or "Web APIs" as in "APIs accessible over the network")

and the following syntactic models:
- JSON-LD "AMF model"
- RAML 0.8 / 1.0 (mapped to "WebApi")
- OpenAPI (OAS) 2.0 / 3.0 (mapped to "WebApi")
- AsyncAPI 2.0 (mapped to "AsyncApi")

The models above and any other models may be extended and supported via custom [AML-defined models](https://a.ml/aml-spec).
Other formats and models that cannot be expressed with AML may also be supported via plugins.

### Features
AMF has many features such as:
- Parsing
- Resolution
    - Stages & Pipelines
- Validation
    - Custom Model Constraints (WebApi)
    - SHACL (Vocabularies & Custom validations)
- Rendering

### Artifacts
Artifacts to use AMF can be obtained from:

-   [Maven](https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/com/github/amlorg/)
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amf-client-js)

In the next section you can learn how to quickly get started using AMF.
