title: Control threads in AMF
---

AMF allows you to schedule and manage the lifespan of threads.
The following explains how to create and use a scheduler in AMF.

:::info
Use of control threads in AMF is specific to Java or Scala applications.
:::

In AMF, common uses of thread control include:

- Addressing memory constraints
- Controlling thread creation
- Inserting time intervals between AMF executions

## Controlling thread generation and lifespan
AMF allows you to control thread generation and lifespan by customizing the **`ExecutionEnvironment`** object.
To customize the ExecutionEnvironment object you need to:

1. Create a `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService`
2. Create an `amf.client.execution.ExecutionEnvironment` with the new scheduler
3. Plug the `ExecutionEnvironment` into AMF initialization or in resolution stage


## Create a `ScheduledExecutorService`
To create a thread pool that can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute them periodically, create a `ScheduledExecutorService`:

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(30, new ThreadFactory() {
            int i = 0;

            @Override
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                i = i + 1;
                final Thread thread = new Thread(r);
                thread.setName("AMF-" + i);
                return thread;
            }
        });
```
This example scheduler keeps 30 threads in the pool (even if they are idle), and creates a specific `ThreadFactory` that sets the thread name when creating a new thread.

### Scheduler API methods
The scheduler exposes the following methods:

- `scheduled()`
    - Schedule a single task execution after a fixed delay
- `scheduleAtFixedRate()`
    - Run a task periodically after a fixed delay
- `shutdown()`
    - Stop the `ExecutorService` from accepting new tasks and shut down after all running threads finish their current work
- `shutdownNow()`
    - Return a list of tasks that are waiting to be processed, and destroy the `ExecutorService` immediately
    - All running threads may not be stopped at the same time


Refer to the Java documentation for more information about the [`ScheduledExecutorService`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html)


## Create and add the `ExecutionEnvironment` in AMF
When initialized, AMF creates a default `amf.client.environment.Environment`. You can customize this environment  by passing an `amf.client.execution.ExecutionEnvironment` object.

The `ExecutionEnvironment` is responsible for thread creation, and it can receive a `ScheduledExecutorService` to use when creating threads.

You can plug your customized `ExecutionEnvironment` into AMF's initialization, or add it when creating a specific parser.

This customized environment can be plugged into AMF's initialization or when creating a specific parser.

## Example code for creating a scheduler
The following example code shows the creation of a scheduler, and its usage throughout AMF:

import CodeGetter from "../../components/CodeGetter";

<CodeGetter
    language='java'
    example='java/SchedulerTest.java'
/>
