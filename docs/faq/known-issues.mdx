There are some known behavior differences between AMF/AML and the specs that they support. In most cases these issues are not corrected because of backwards compatibility.

## Case-insensitive Boolean Support

According to the defined in the [RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-3), the accepted JSON boolean values are `true` and `false` (lower-case).

Currently, SYAML, our YAML and JSON parser, is accepting boolean values in lower-case, upper-case or camel-case as valid (`true`, `TRUE`, `True`).
