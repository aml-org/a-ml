After you add the AMF initialize method to your application code, you can initialize AMF and register the plugins you intend to use.

The initialization method, `AMF.init()` registers the following plugins:
- WebApi
- Vocabularies
- AMFCustomValidation
- PayloadValidatorPlugin

The `AMF.init()` method initializes the core functions of AMF by running `amf.Core.init()`, as show in the following snippet:

```scala title="AMF.scala"
def init(executionEnvironment: BaseExecutionEnvironment): ClientFuture[Unit] = {
    WebApi.register(executionEnvironment)
    Vocabularies.register()
    AMFCustomValidation.register()
    amf.Core.registerPlugin(PayloadValidatorPlugin)
    amf.Core.init(executionEnvironment)
}
```

Depending on your use case, you can cherry-pick and use only the plugins you need. For example, if you wanted to parse and resolve the OAS 3.0 specification,
you would need only the WebApi plugin:

```java
WebApi.register();
Core.init().get();
```

For more information on parsing, see [Parsing with AMF](amf_parsing).
