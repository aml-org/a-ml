This documentation explains only a small fraction of the AMF model's functionality.
For more detailed information about the model, refer to the [AMF model documentation](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md).

There you'll learn how AMF represents different concepts for different API specifications, as well as for abstract models, such as:

- [WebApi](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#webapi)
- [Document](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#document)
- [Shape](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#shape)
- [Dialect](https://github.com/aml-org/amf/blob/develop/documentation/model.md#dialect)
