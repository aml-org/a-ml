title: Custom resource loaders
---

AMF allows you to define custom resource loaders that you can fully customize and plug into AMFâ€™s parsers.

By default, AMF provides the following resource loaders:

- JVM
  - `FileResourceLoader`
  - `HttpResourceLoader`
- JS Server
  - `JsServerFileResourceLoader`
  - `JsServerHttpResourceLoader`
- JS Browser
  - `JsBrowserHttpResourceLoader`

However, you may encounter situations in which you need to parse resources that can't be fetched by a HTTP or file resource loader.
Or you may have cases where you want to use a custom nomenclature or resolution mechanism for the URIs used to reference content.

In such cases, use custom resource loaders.

## Implement a new resource loader
To implement a new resource loader, extend the `amf.client.resource.ResourceLoader` interface and define your own resource loader.

The ResourceLoader interface contains two methods, `fetch` and `accepts`:

```scala title="amf.client.resource.ResourceLoader.scala"
  /** Fetch specified resource and return associated content. Resource should have been previously accepted. */
  /** If the resource not exists, you should return a future failed with an ResourceNotFound exception. */
  def fetch(resource: String): ClientFuture[Content]

  /** Accepts specified resource. */
  def accepts(resource: String): Boolean = true
```

- `accepts(resource: string): boolean`
    - AMF uses this method to ask every resource loader in the environment if it can fetch the current resource.
    If a loader can't fetch the resource, AMF raises an `UnsupportedUrlScheme` exception.

- `fetch(resource: string): ClientFuture[Content]`
    - This method loads the resource according to your custom implementation, and returns an asynchronous `Content` object.

AMF stores the `Content` object at `amf.client.remote.Content`, and it contains:

- The resource fetched as a stream
- The URL from which the resource was fetched
- The [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of the resource


## Configure your custom resource loader
All parsers receive an optional `Environment` parameter in their constructor.
You can use the `Environment` parameter to add your custom resource loaders:

```java title="CustomResourceLoader.java"
Environment env = DefaultEnvironment.apply().add(new CustomResourceLoader());
Raml10Parser parser = new Raml10Parser(env);
```

## How URI normalization works
Before fetching, every URI goes through a **normalization** process to ensure consistency and standardization.
Normalization includes the following steps:

  1. **Encode string**: Computes a new version of the string in which each instance of certain characters is replaced by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing UTF-8 character encoding.

  2. **Normalization (`java.net.URI.normalize`)**: Transforms a URI into a normalized, or canonical, URI to determine if two syntactically different URIs are equivalent.

  3. **Resolve relativeness**: If a URI is relative, appends the location of the file from which the URI originates to the base of the processed relative URI.

### Example URI normalization
The following example demonstrates the normalization process using a RAML API that references an external JSON file:

- URI of main RAML API: `file:///Users/user/api.raml`
- Reference to JSON file: `type: !include ./folder/../external file.json`

The URI is normalized following the three steps described above:

- **Encode string**
    - The URI is transformed to `./folder/../external%20file.json`. The blank space between words is encoded.
- **Normalization**
    - The relative path and folder structure are removed, the URI is transformed to `external%20file.json`.
- **Resolve relativeness**
    - The reference was relative, so the URI of the main file is appended to the base of the reference URI: `file:///Users/user/external%20file.json`

Finally, resource loaders will use the following normalized URI to fetch the JSON file: `file:///Users/user/external%20file.json`.

## Example code for a custom resource loader
The following example code is for a custom resource loader that obtains resources using a custom protocol:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeGetter from "/components/CodeGetter";

<Tabs
    groupId="languages"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
        {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}
    ]}
>

<TabItem value="java">
    <CodeGetter
        language='java'
        example='java/ResourceLoaderTest.java'
    />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">
    <CodeGetter
        language='js'
        example='js/resource-loader.test.js'
    />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
