:::caution
The following features of AMF error handling are still in development:
- Support for custom error handling in parsing, validation, and emission stages
- Javascript support
:::

## AMF error handlers

An error handler is a mechanism that lets you handle any errors that arise while using AMF.
You can define custom error handlers and use them as plugins in AMF's resolution stage.

There are 3 types of errors in AMF, denoted by the `amf.core.validation.SeverityLevels` object:

- **Info**
  - Indicates something may or may not be wrong
  - Typically informational depending on user intent
- **Warning**
  - Indicates that something is not correct and action is required
  - Includes warnings about future changes, tool deprecations, or errors that will become violations in the future
- **Violation**
  - Indicates that something is in violation of normal operations or is not compliant with its specification
  - Invalidates the AMF graph model

## How error handling works in AMF
AMF transforms each error into a `ValidationResult`, and collects all generated results in a `ValidationReport`.
After the [validation stage](../AMF/Using%20AMF/amf_validation#validation-examples), AMF returns the ValidationReport.

```scala title="amf.core.validation.core.ValidationReport"
trait ValidationResult {
  def message: Option[String]
  def path: String
  def sourceConstraintComponent: String
  def focusNode: String
  def severity: String
  def sourceShape: String
}

trait ValidationReport {
  def conforms: Boolean
  def results: List[ValidationResult]
}
```
## Example `ValidationReport`
For example, consider the following OAS 3.0 API:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "test api",
    "version": "1"
  }
}
```

This API is invalid as it doesn't have the `paths:{}` object that is required by the
[OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#schema).
In this case, AMF returns the following `ValidationReport`:

```text
Profile: OAS 3.0
Conforms? false
Number of results: 1
- Source: http://a.ml/vocabularies/amf/parser#mandatory-paths-property
  Message: 'paths' is mandatory in OAS spec
  Level: Violation
  Target: file://amf-client/shared/src/test/resources/validations/oas3/paths-property.json#/web-api
  Property:
  Position: None
  Location:
```

The report contains detailed error information, but with a custom error handler, you could implement additional behavior to:

- Stop execution when a certain type of error is found
- Process, modify, or log incoming errors
- Run and check errors of a single stage (for example, parse an OAS 2.0 API and check if it has parsing errors)

To add custom functionality, you need to implement the provided **error handler interface**.

## Implement the error handler interface
The error handler interface is located at `amf.client.resolve`, as it's used only in the resolution stage.
The error handler interface declares the method **`reportConstraint()`**, which AMF uses to report runtime errors:

```scala title="amf.client.resolve.ClientErrorHandler"
trait ClientErrorHandler {

  def reportConstraint(id: String,
                       node: String,
                       property: ClientOption[String],
                       message: String,
                       range: ClientOption[amf.core.parser.Range],
                       level: String,
                       location: ClientOption[String]): Unit
}
```

The method takes the following arguments:

- **`id`**
    - The id of the error
- **`node`**
    - The AMF model node containing the error
- **`property`** (optional)
    - The specific property that is faulty
- **`message`**
    - The message that describes the error
- **`range`** (optional)
    - The specific part of the parsed file that generates the error
- **`level`**
    - The SeverityLevel of the error: info, warning, or violation
- **`location`** (optional)
    - The error's location in the AMF graph model


## Example code for a custom error handler
The following example code is for a custom error handler that throws an exception when an error is found:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeGetter from "/components/CodeGetter";

<Tabs
    groupId="languages"
    defaultValue="java"
    values={[
        {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
        {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}
    ]}
>

<TabItem value="java">
    <CodeGetter
        language='java'
        example='java/ErrorHandlerTest.java'
    />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">
    <CodeGetter
        language='js'
        example='js/error-handler.test.js'
    />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
